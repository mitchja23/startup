# Elevator Pitch

 Many people struggle to stay orginized and get certain tasks done. This piece of software is used to combat that by allowing an interactive to do list. Add your friends to see if they are keeping up with their daily goals, while also being held accountable to yours. By completing tasks, your friends are able to judge if you actually completed your goals. Once completed you are gifted coins that can be spent on mini games and other in game cosmetics that can be used to decorate your profile and show off to others.
